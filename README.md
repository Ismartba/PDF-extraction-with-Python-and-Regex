# Extracting Data from PDFs with Python

## Introduction

Ever faced the daunting task of extracting data from a vast, oddly structured PDF? Or perhaps you've had to parse through numerous PDFs to pull out specific information. In this guide, we dive into a practical example: extracting financial transactions from a Credit Card statement using Python and Regular Expressions.

## Objective

We leverage three powerful Python libraries—`pandas`, `re` (Regular Expressions), and `pypdf`—to build a script capable of:

- Reading PDF files
- Processing text for easier manipulation
- Identifying and extracting the needed data
- Cleaning and organizing the extracted data

## The Toolkit

- **Pandas:** For efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Re (Regular Expressions):** To pinpoint specific text patterns within the PDF.
- **Pypdf:** Facilitates reading and extracting text from PDF files, making the data accessible for processing.

## Diving into the Code

1. **Visualizing the PDF Structure:**
   - Use `pypdf.PdfReader` to open a PDF and inspect its text structure.
   - Preprocess the text by cleaning strange characters and standardizing the text for easy processing.

2. **From Text to Transactions:**
   - Employ Regular Expressions to find transaction patterns.
   - Extract and convert matching groups into transaction data.

3. **Crafting Data Frames:**
   - Organize transaction details into pandas DataFrames for easy analysis and manipulation.
   - Enhance DataFrames with additional details like the source filename for context.

## Conclusion & Practical Applications

This project highlights the practicality of custom scripts in extracting information from PDFs, a common challenge in various work scenarios. Despite potential complexities, such as analyzing the PDF structure or handling false positives in Regex capturing, this approach can significantly streamline data extraction processes.
